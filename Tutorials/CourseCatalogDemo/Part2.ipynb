    "## Preliminaries: Scraping PDFs with Tabula\n",
    "__1. First, let's experience the unique challenge of pulling data from PDF files.__  \n",
    "Take a look at the Fairfield University's [Spring 2018 Undergraduate Course Booklet](201801CourseBooklet.pdf). You'll see lots of pseudo-tabular text, where data is organized into rows and columns. However, when you try to copy text from a table like this ...\n",
    "![Copy from PDF](img/P2_Copy_from_PDF.png)\n",
    "and then paste it into a text file you get this:\n",
    "![Paste from PDF](img/P2_Paste_from_PDF.png)\n",
    "Whoah, where'd the table go? Why is everything all jumbled? The dirty little secret of PDF files is that they are actually designed to minimize the work of displaying printed pages, not for us to use as data. The order in which the text is stored in the file is irrelevant as long as the physical location on the page is known. As far as PDF writers care, text is just shapes on a page. So, it's kind of random where everything ends up within the physical PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. In this exercise we are going to extract data from the course booklet into a CSV file and then clean it up using standard Python.__  \n",
    "For the first part we are going to use [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/), which promises to be just the right tool for the job:\n",
    "> **How Can Tabula Help Me?**    \n",
    "If you’ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in PDFs, you know how painful it is — there's no easy way to copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. Tabula allows you to extract that data into a CSV or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using a simple, easy-to-use interface. Tabula works on Mac, Windows and Linux.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Who Uses Tabula?**    \n",
    "Tabula is used to power investigative reporting at news organizations of all sizes, including ProPublica, The Times of London, Foreign Policy, La Nación (Argentina), The New York Times and the St. Paul (MN) Pioneer Press.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Grassroots organizations like SchoolCuts.org rely on Tabula to turn clunky documents into human-friendly public resources.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">And researchers of all kinds use Tabula to turn PDF reports into Excel spreadsheets, CSVs, and JSON files for use in analysis and database applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So why do we need Python if Tabula creates CSV files?** Even with all of the smarts Tabula provides, it still has to make a lot of guesses about the structure of the original table, the most problematic of which is picking out the column breaks. In PDFs there are no tabs or spaces. Those are just whitespace between characters. So, is a given bit of whitespace long enough to indicate a new column or is it just a normal space within the column text? It's almost impossible to tell sometimes and Tabula sometimes. The resulting CSV files may then have commas (column separators) in some places and be missing commas in others. Unfortunately for us, even one misplaced or missing comma can totally ruin our CSV file, so we have t clean the CSV before we can use it in our analyses. Fortunately, we the analysts (presumably) know what the original table was about and can usually make corrections manually. Or, better yet, use Python to do it for us. We just have to encode the correction rules and let Python do the rest.      \n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Tabula is a Java-based installable web app.__  \n",
    "The app requires a recent version of Java to install. Once installed it operates as a (fairly spare but functional) web app on your `localhost` (i.e., a web server running on your computer), just like JupyterLab.\n",
    "![Tabula Web App](img/P2_Tabula_Web_App.png)\n",
    "![Tabula Import Screen](img/P2_Tabula_Import_Manager.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Importing a PDF and Extracting Data.__  \n",
    "From the main screen you can `Import` a PDF file on your hard drive and then `Extract Data`. Tabula will open the file and invite you to Select Tables.\n",
    "![Select Tables](img/P2_Select_Tables.png)\n",
    "Select each table you want to scrape by dragging out boxes with your mouse. Or, if you prefer, let Tabula Autodetect the tables for you and then correct any erroneous selections yourself.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case the tables we want start on page 13 of the printed booklet:\n",
    "![Autoselect Tables](img/P2_Autoselect_Tables.png)\n",
    "It seems to be doing a decent job, though (as we'll see) it has problems when tables span page breaks. With a bit of fiddling with the selections, however, you can get it mostly right. It certainly beats retyping it yourself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the tables have been selected, use the Preview and Export Extracted Data to generate a CSV file. \n",
    "![Preview showing erroneous column breaks](img/P2_Erroneous_Column_Breaks.png)\n",
    "Oops, it looks like we found a bad column break. Can you spot it? Hmmm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's export to CSV and then fix it ourselves. \n",
    "![Export Button](img/P2_Export_Button.png)\n",
    "Before moving on, take a moment to study the finished [tabula-201801CatalogBooklet.csv](tabula-201801CatalogBooklet.csv) file."
