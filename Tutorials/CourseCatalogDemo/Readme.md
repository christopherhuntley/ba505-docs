# The Course Catalog Demo

## Overview
This tutorial is a week-by-week walkthrough of an ETL project from start to finish. It is provided as an demonstration, not a challenge. You will not be required to program anything yourself but try to follow along. It includes lots of relevant examples of how to collect and clean data from lots of sources. 

__You are encouraged to collaborate with your peers.__ However, you are also responsible for learning each week's key lessons. So, if you need help understanding something, just ask! If you know how to help someone (without doing the work for them), then please help them out.
